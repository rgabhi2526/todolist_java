# Java Project: TO_DO_LIST

This repository contains Java programs designed to facilitate various data processing tasks. The repository includes three main files:

1. **run.java** - Core script that manages the execution and configuration of data processing routines.
2. **src.java** - Contains helper functions and primary data manipulation logic.
3. **to_list.java** - Provides functionality to convert processed data into a list format for further use.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: Each file is designed with specific functionality to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
- **Data Conversion**: `to_list.java` includes methods to transform datasets into list structures for efficient handling and further processing.
- **Execution Control**: `run_n.java` provides an interface to manage different operations, making it flexible for various use cases.

## Requirements

- **Java 8** or higher
- Dependencies (if any) should be specified here.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rgabhi2526/todolist_java/tree/f88cefc49170eef609d798f4ed48cb1e9b2f4f4d
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. Compile the Java files.
   ```bash
   javac run_n.java src.java to_list.java
   ```

## Usage

1. **Running the Project**:
   Run the main file (`run.java`) to start the data processing pipeline.
   ```bash
   java run_n
   ```

2. **Modifying Data Sources**:
   Adjust parameters in `src.java` or `to_list.java` based on your dataset requirements.
